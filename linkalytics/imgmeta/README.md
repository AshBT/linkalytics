# Initializing

To initialize the Redis DB, run `./populate.py PATH/TO/CLUSTER/FOLDER`. This
will grab the expected tsv files and write the needed information to Redis.
This should only be run once.

# Running
You can run the metadata tool standalone using `metafactors` or it can be
installed as a worker for the linkalytics server.
